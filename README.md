# Weather Project
This is my first proper project! I've created a weather app that allows users to check the current temperature for any location. To use it you need to replace the API key with your own. You can obtain an API key from the OpenWeatherMap API
"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjuxqDNzueJAxVe3jgGHa6zDEQQFnoECAsQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopenweathermap.org%2Fapi&usg=AOvVaw1SEmG6hjVwGocnSh0eZnFM&opi=89978449".




# How to Use
Enter the name of a location (e.g., "Australia").
The app will display a new window showing the location you entered along with the current temperature.
